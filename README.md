# QuotesGuessingGame

This was an assigment in a Python course I did.\
I liked this game so much that I posted it as a project.

In this game, I scrape the site : https://quotes.toscrape.com/

I show the quote to the player and ask the player to guess the name of the author.
If the player guessed wrong  I provide the player with hints until the player sucseeds or until 4 guesses, then I show the answer.
